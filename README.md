# Privacy Policy for NetSapiens Click-to-Dial

**Last Updated: February 17, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how the NetSapiens Click-to-Dial browser extension (the "Extension") handles user data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
To provide click-to-dial functionality, the Extension interacts with the following data:

* **Authentication Information:** The Extension stores your NetSapiens credentials or API tokens locally to authenticate calls via your service provider.
* **Website Content:** The Extension scans the text of web pages you visit to identify phone numbers and convert them into clickable links. This data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to us.
* **User Activity:** When you click a phone number, the Extension sends that specific number to the NetSapiens API to initiate the call.

## 2. Data Storage and Security
* All user settings and credentials are stored within the browser's secure local storage (`chrome.storage`).
* We do not use any external databases to store your personal information or call history.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
* **No Sale of Data:** We do not sell, trade, or rent user data to third parties.
* **Third-Party Service:** Data (phone numbers and auth tokens) is only transmitted to the NetSapiens communication platform associated with your user account to facilitate the calling service.

## 4. Compliance
This Extension complies with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies, including the Limited Use requirements. We only use data to provide the core functionality of the Extension.

## 5. Contact
For questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact the developer via the support email provided in the Chrome Web Store listing.
